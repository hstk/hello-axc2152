# Rust on the AXC2152

Luckily, the AXC2152 is an ARMv7, which we can target it with languages and tools that use LLVM. Including Rust!

Rust is a homerun choice for embedded applications. It has an expressive type system that makes it well suited for resource constrained environments. The tooling is fantastic, the community is large and friendly. For a tutorial, a great and free resource is [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch00-00-introduction.html).
